# Selma's HW13 Node_Express_Handlebars

## Description:

In this activity, I am utilizing the node packages mysql, express and express-handlebars to create an eat-the-burger full stack application. In this app, you can enter your own burger of choice. Once the burger is submitted it is added to a list that is always retained via a SQL database . Then you have the option to devour the burgers you placed on the list to move them to another devoured list that is also retained via the SQL database. I also built my own ORM (object relational mapping). I learned how to write routes and utilize callback results to get all the correct burger information.

## A couple of things I learned in this:

- Node package express-handlebars
- How to deploy to JawsDB
- Built my own ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
- Node package mysql
- .env
- Node package express
- Routing
- Callbacks
